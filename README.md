This project provides a user-friendly Streamlit web app to estimate **Biological Age (BA)** based on clinical biomarkers. Users can input their values, and the model will output:

- ‚úÖ Their predicted biological age
- üìä A comparison with peers of the same chronological age
- üéØ Percentile ranking within that group
- üìà A clean, transparent density plot of BA distribution

## üß† How It Works

- The app uses a trained **XGBoost regression model** to predict Biological Age based on user inputs.
- The clinical inputs are scaled using a saved `StandardScaler` to match model training.
- The model then estimates the BA and compares it to age-matched distributions from the training dataset.
- The output includes:
  - Predicted BA
  - Age group percentile
  - Transparent density plot of BA distribution with user's BA highlighted
